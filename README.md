# Interest Calculator

This repository includes a solution for calculating a default interest schedule based on interest rates defined by the Bank of Greece.

## How To Use
Currently the solution supports user interaction through a console app. On application startup, the user is prompted to input capital amount, 
start and end date. The system then calculates and displays interest amounts for different default interest rates per period, total interest amount 
and total amount of capital plus interest.

Default interest rates are acquired from Bank of Greece by this [webpage](https://www.bankofgreece.gr/statistika/xrhmatopistwtikes-agores/ekswtrapezika-epitokia).
